# Contributing

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run setup:config
```

## Checks

Run focused checks while developing, then run the relevant broader checks before committing:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm test -- tests/tool-contracts.test.ts tests/mcp-contract.test.ts
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Use targeted tests for the area you changed before broad validation.

## Safety Rules

- Do not add shell execution or arbitrary command-runner tools.
- Do not weaken sandbox, secret, path, write, git, or cleanup policies.
- Keep tool changes contract-first: contracts -> toolContracts -> catalog -> define-tool -> handlers -> services.
- Keep the tool catalog metadata-only and handlers thin.
- Put real behavior in services and policy decisions in policy/service layers.
- Mutating tools require explicit policy, safe defaults, and focused tests.
